Welcome to Fornite!

This game is similar to the actual fornite, besides fighting opponents.

The user will choose locations on the "island" where at each location they choose an item to pick up.

That inventory item must be used right away, and will effect your overall health accordingly.

How to win: reach a health of 150+
How to lose: reach a health of 0-
How to stop playing: input exit when choosing location

Note: The user can also lose health by not choosing an available loot/item to pick up (i.e. they already took that item), or type in an invalid item.
